# Graphs & Trees Data Structures in Python

## 📚 Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook exploring graph and tree data structures, their implementations, and various algorithms. The notebook provides both theoretical explanations and practical Python implementations.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Three main graph representations:
    - Adjacency List
    - Edge List
    - Adjacency Matrix
- Implementation of key graph algorithms:
    - Degree calculation
    - Representation conversion
    - Adjacency checking
    - Completeness verification
    - Connectivity testing
    - Walk/Trail/Path identification
- Tree-specific operations:
    - Spanning tree generation
    - Leaf node counting
    - Binary tree verification
    - Height and depth calculations

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage
1. Clone this repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iPriyadarshi/Graph-Tree
    cd Graph-Tree
    ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    ### On Windows
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    ### On macOS/Linux
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook

    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Navigate to and open the notebook:
   - Click on the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter's interface
   - Select "Kernel" > "Restart & Run All" to execute all cells

5. Explore the implementations:
   - Run cells individually with Shift+Enter
   - Modify parameters and test different inputs
   - Experiment with the graph algorithms
   - Visualize results using provided functions

6. Save your changes:
   - Use Ctrl+S or File > Save and Checkpoint
   - Export as different formats via File > Download as
