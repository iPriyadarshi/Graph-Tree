    "Graphs can be represented in various ways depending on the use case and the type of problem being solved. Here are the primary ways to represent a graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adjacency List**\n",
    "2. **Edge List**\n",
    "3. **Adjacency Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Adjacency List**\n",
    "\n",
    "An adjacency list represents a graph as a dictionary or a list of lists, where each vertex (node) stores a list of adjacent vertices it connects to. This representation is efficient in terms of memory and is ideal for sparse graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of an Adjacency List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the graph with vertices **1, 2, 3, 4** and edges: **(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph = {\n",
    "    1: [2, 3],\n",
    "    2: [1, 3],\n",
    "    3: [1, 2, 4],\n",
    "    4: [3]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each key represents a node, and its corresponding list contains adjacent nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses less memory for sparse graphs.\n",
    "- Easy to iterate through neighbors of a node.\n",
    "- Efficient for depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Checking if an edge exists between two specific nodes takes more time compared to an adjacency matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Edge List**\n",
    "\n",
    "An edge list stores a graph as a collection of pairs (or tuples), where each pair represents an edge between two vertices. This representation is useful for storing and processing edge-based graph algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of an Edge List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the same graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "edges = [\n",
    "    (1, 2),\n",
    "    (1, 3),\n",
    "    (2, 3),\n",
    "    (3, 4)\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tuple represents an edge between two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple to store and process edges directly.\n",
    "- Suitable for algorithms that focus primarily on edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Difficult to find all adjacent vertices of a given node quickly.\n",
    "- Not efficient for checking if two nodes are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Adjacency Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "An adjacency matrix represents a graph using a 2D array (matrix), where each row and column correspond to a vertex, and the cell values indicate whether an edge exists between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of an Adjacency Matrix:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the same graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  1  2  3  4\n",
    "1 0  1  1  0\n",
    "2 1  0  1  0\n",
    "3 1  1  0  1\n",
    "4 0  0  1  0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "adj_matrix = [\n",
    "    [0, 1, 1, 0],  # Node 1 connections\n",
    "    [1, 0, 1, 0],  # Node 2 connections\n",
    "    [1, 1, 0, 1],  # Node 3 connections\n",
    "    [0, 0, 1, 0]   # Node 4 connections\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A **1** in `adj_matrix[i][j]` means an edge exists between node `i` and node `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quick edge lookups (checking if two nodes are connected).\n",
    "- Efficient for dense graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses **O(V²)** space, which is inefficient for sparse graphs.\n",
    "- Iterating through adjacent nodes is slower compared to an adjacency list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Choosing the Best Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjacency List** → Best for sparse graphs and traversal algorithms.\n",
    "- **Edge List** → Best for edge-based graph processing.\n",
    "- **Adjacency Matrix** → Best for dense graphs and quick edge lookups.\n"
